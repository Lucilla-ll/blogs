# Integrating AI with Strapi: A Week of Challenges and Wins

**May 10, 2024** 

## A Productive Short Week
The week after Labour Day was intense—despite having only four working days, I made significant progress:

### **1. UI Improvements** 

- Enhanced article cover visibility by adding a dark background.
- Localized article dates using the date-fns SDK.
- Documented the AppsFlyer web smart banner’s behavior.

### **2. Website Optimization**  

- Separated ad layouts for desktop and mobile views (collaboration with the Website Optimization Team).

### **3. The Big Win: AI Integration in Strapi** 
- After weeks of development, our Strapi-Gemini AI plugin is now fully functional!

## Behind the Scenes: How We Built It
### Choosing the Right AI Model
- **Requirement**: Generate content for overseas financial products.
- **First Attempt**: Domestic models (e.g., Aliyun) failed due to limited knowledge of international markets.
- **Solution**: Switched to Google Gemini for its multilingual capabilities and cost-effectiveness.

### Development Challenges
1. **IP Blocking:**
Gemini blocked our office IP.
Workaround: Used GeoVPN (Clash Verge failed on Windows due to proxy configuration issues).

2. **Technical Implementation:**
Built a Strapi plugin with a dedicated work.js thread to handle API calls.
Added a trigger button in Strapi’s admin panel:

```
javascript
// Simplified API call example
async function fetchAIResponse(prompt) {
  const response = await GeminiAPI.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-pro",
    prompt: prompt,
  });
  return response.text();
}
```

3. **Environment-Specific Issues:**
QA vs. Prod: Requests were blocked in production due to Strapi’s firewall.
Fix: Collaborated with DevOps to whitelist endpoints and verify server configurations.

## Lessons Learned & Future Optimizations
1. Observability:
Added timestamps to error logs for faster debugging.
2. Control:
Implemented a manual kill switch for the work.js thread.
3. Scalability:
Planning to migrate from single-threaded to a queue-based system (e.g., Bull.js).

## Conclusion
Seeing this feature go live felt like "watching a planted flower finally bloom"—frustrations during development made the success even sweeter.

### Key Takeaways:
- Always test in production-like environments early.
- VPNs are lifesavers for global API access.
- Collaboration across teams (DevOps, Networking) is critical.
